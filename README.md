# 📈 ProductUsage-TimeSeriesForecasting

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook pipeline for time series forecasting of product usage data. The solution is designed to predict usage quantities over a future period by validating, preprocessing, visualizing, and modeling weekly usage records for multiple entities using various forecasting techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Validate and preprocess time series data for quality and consistency.
- Visualize trends, missing values, and outliers for each entity.
- Develop and compare forecasting models: **ARIMA**, **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.
- Forecast usage quantities for a defined future period.
- Identify the best-performing model per entity using **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **MAPE**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

> **Note:** Dataset is not included in this repository.

Expected dataset format:

- `Entity Identifier`: Unique ID for each entity.
- `Week-Ending Date`: Date marking the end of the week.
- `Total Usage Quantity`: Total usage for the week.
- `Subcategory Usage Quantity` *(optional)*: Usage for a specific product type.

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Data Validation
- Check for null/duplicate identifiers, invalid date formats, and inconsistent week-ending dates.
- Ensure logical consistency in numerical fields (e.g., subcategory ≤ total usage).
- Identify missing weekly data per entity.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Convert dates and numeric fields to correct types; handle non-numeric values.
- Forward-fill missing values (≤10% missing).
- Cap outliers using the **IQR method** for continuity.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Plot missing value timelines and outliers.
- Visualize weekly usage trends across entities.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Create **lagged features** (3 lags) for regression models.
- Split data into **train/test sets** based on a cutoff date.

### 5. Model Training
Four models are trained:
- **ARIMA**: Classical time series model with differencing.
- **Linear Regression**: Baseline model with lagged features.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Ensemble model with 100 trees.
- **XGBoost**: Optimized using `GridSearchCV` over `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`, and `subsample`.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Metrics used: **MAE**, **RMSE**, **MAPE**.
- Best model per entity selected based on **lowest MAE**, using RMSE/MAPE as tiebreakers.

### 7. Inference
- Forecast future usage using the best model for each entity.
- Visualize forecast results alongside historical data.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProductUsage-TimeSeriesForecasting.git
cd ProductUsage-TimeSeriesForecasting
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

> Place your dataset (e.g., `usage_data.xlsx`) in the root directory.

### Launch

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open `forecasting.ipynb` and run all cells to execute the full pipeline.

---

## 📈 Usage

Running the notebook will:

1. Load and validate your dataset.
2. Preprocess and visualize the data.
3. Train and evaluate ARIMA, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
4. Produce and display forecasts for the desired future period.

### Outputs

* Visualizations (inline in the notebook).
* Forecasts stored in a dictionary.
* Model evaluation metrics printed in the notebook.

## 🔮 Next Steps

* Encode **cyclical features** (day-of-week, week-of-year) using sine/cosine transformations.
* Add **rolling statistics** (mean, std, min, max) to model trends and volatility.
* Explore **advanced models**: Prophet, SARIMA, LSTM.
* Use **auto\_arima** from `pmdarima` for automatic ARIMA parameter selection.
* Extend hyperparameter tuning to other models.
* Forecast **subcategory usage** in addition to total usage.
* Incorporate **external data** (e.g., weather, events).
* Implement **deep learning** models (e.g., LSTM) for long time series.
